## Status: NOT AFFECTED ✅

**Date**: December 6, 2025  
**Severity**: Critical (if affected)  
**CVE ID**: CVE-2025-55182  
**Vulnerability**: React2Shell - Remote Code Execution in React Server Components

## Summary

This repository has been analyzed for the CVE-2025-55182 vulnerability and is **NOT AFFECTED**.

## Vulnerability Details

CVE-2025-55182 affects the following versions:
- **react-server-dom-***: 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0
- **Next.js**: 14.3.0-canary, 15.x, and 16.x (App Router)

Any framework bundling React Server Components is potentially affected, including:
- Next.js
- Vite RSC plugin
- Parcel RSC plugin
- React Router RSC preview
- RedwoodSDK
- Waku

## Analysis Results

### Current Dependencies
- **React**: 18.3.1 ✅ (Not vulnerable - vulnerability only affects React 19.x)
- **React-DOM**: 18.3.1 ✅ (Not vulnerable)
- **Next.js**: Not installed ✅
- **react-server-dom**: Not installed ✅
- **RSC Frameworks**: None detected ✅

### Projects Analyzed
1. `/ui` - Main UI application (Vite + React 18.3.1)
2. `/bot/dashboard` - Bot dashboard (Vite + React 18.3.1)
3. All other package.json files in the repository

### Verification Steps Performed
1. ✅ Scanned all package.json files for vulnerable dependencies
2. ✅ Verified installed React versions in node_modules
3. ✅ Checked yarn.lock files for indirect dependencies
4. ✅ Searched for Next.js installations
5. ✅ Searched for react-server-dom packages
6. ✅ Checked for RSC framework plugins

## Preventive Measures

To prevent accidental installation of vulnerable packages in the future:

### 1. Pin React Versions
Current React versions are already pinned to 18.3.1 using the `^` semver range, which is appropriate.

### 2. Avoid Early React 19 Adoption
If upgrading to React 19 in the future, ensure you use patched versions:
- React 19.0.1+ (not 19.0.0)
- React 19.1.2+ (not 19.1.0 or 19.1.1)
- React 19.2.1+ (not 19.2.0)

### 3. Security Scanning
Consider implementing automated security scanning in CI/CD:
```bash
# Using npm audit or yarn audit
yarn audit

# Using Snyk or similar tools
snyk test
```
