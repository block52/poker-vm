The Validator Rights (as defined herein), and the Validator NFTs representing them, are not intended to constitute capital markets products, securities or securities-based derivatives contracts of any form, units in a business trust, units in a collective investment scheme or any other form of investment in any jurisdiction. The Validator Rights and the Validator NFTs are not intended to be a medium of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for discharge of a debt. This Agreement is not a prospectus, offering document, nor a solicitation or investment and it does not pertain in any way to an offering of capital markets products, securities or securities-based derivatives contracts of any form, units in a business trust, units in a collective investment scheme or any other form of investment in any jurisdiction. This Agreement has not been registered under the securities laws of any jurisdiction. No regulatory authority has examined or approved this Agreement, and no action has been or will be taken in respect of obtaining such approval by Yieldi Holdings Limited under the laws, regulations or rules of any jurisdiction. Please note that Yieldi Holdings Limited will not offer or sell to you, and you are not eligible to purchase any Validator Rights if such Validator Right Sale (as defined herein) is prohibited, restricted or unauthorised in any form or manner whether in full or in part under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules in the jurisdiction in which you are located, at the time of your intended purchase or purchase of the Validator Rights pursuant to this Agreement.

Participation in the new offering involves a high degree of risks. You should carefully review the information provided to you in connection herewith, together with all the other information contained in this Agreement, before deciding to purchase Validator Right(s).

The Company is undertaking a private sale of Validator Rights ("Validator Right Sale"). This Agreement (including the Appendices herein) ("Agreement") sets out the terms and conditions in respect of the acquisition by the Purchaser (as defined below) of such number of validator rights ("Validator Right") which enable access to nodes in the Block52 project (the "Project") and participation in its technical infrastructure, for the Consideration (as defined below) ("Acquisition"). Each Validator Right confers the right to operate one validator node in the Block52 project, and each Validator Right is represented through a unique non-fungible token ("Validator NFT"). The Validator NFTs are a technical delivery mechanism for enabling access to such rights, and are not intended to function as a store of value, medium of exchange, or speculative investment instrument.

The Purchaser and the Company (each a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties") acknowledge and agree that this Agreement constitutes a legally binding and enforceable agreement between the Parties.
