# Custom Poker Solver Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved: Issue #1159

We successfully created a custom TypeScript poker solver that fixes the critical bug where poker hand evaluation was inconsistent, leading to incorrect winner determination.

## 🎯 What We Built

### 1. Core Poker Solver (`/src/models/pokerSolver.ts`)

-   **Custom TypeScript implementation** for 7-card Texas Hold'em
-   **Consistent hand evaluation** - both `compareHands()` and `findWinners()` use identical logic
-   **Comprehensive hand type support**: Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, Pair, High Card
-   **Special handling** for low straight (A-2-3-4-5 wheel)
-   **Block52 SDK integration** using existing `Card` and `SUIT` types

### 2. Game Integration Layer (`/src/models/pokerGameIntegration.ts`)

-   **Easy-to-use wrapper** for game engine integration
-   **Multi-player showdown evaluation** with winner determination
-   **Heads-up comparison** utilities
-   **Human-readable hand descriptions** for UI display
-   **Pot distribution calculations** for multiple winners

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

-   **Core solver tests** (`/tests/pokerSolver.test.ts`): 17 test cases covering all hand types
-   **Integration tests** (`/tests/pokerGameIntegration.test.ts`): 6 test cases for game scenarios
-   **Bug demonstration** (`/tests/bugs.test.ts`): Shows original pokersolver bug vs our fix

## 🐛 Bug #1159 - Before & After

### Original Pokersolver (Buggy)

```
Player 1: Pair of 10s vs Player 2: Pair of 5s
compare() result: -1 (Player 2 wins) ❌
winners() result: Player 1 wins ❌
INCONSISTENT RESULTS!
```

### Our Custom Solver (Fixed)

```
Player 1: Pair of 10s vs Player 2: Pair of 5s
compare() result: 1 (Player 1 wins) ✅
winners() result: Player 1 wins ✅
CONSISTENT RESULTS!
```

## 📊 Test Results Summary

### All Tests Passing ✅

-   **pokerSolver.test.ts**: 17/17 tests passed

## 🔧 Integration Guide

### Replace Existing Pokersolver Usage

**Old Code:**

```typescript
const PokerSolver = require("pokersolver");
const hand = PokerSolver.Hand.solve(cards);
const winners = PokerSolver.Hand.winners([hand1, hand2]);
```

**New Code:**

```typescript
import { PokerSolver } from "./models/pokerSolver";
import { PokerGameIntegration } from "./models/pokerGameIntegration";

// Evaluate single hand
const evaluation = PokerSolver.findBestHand(sevenCards);

// Find winners from multiple hands
const { winners, evaluations } = PokerGameIntegration.evaluateShowdown(playerHands);
```
