/**
 * This test suite was implemented to address and verify the fix for a double increment issue
 * in the turn index tracking system. Previously, there was a bug where the turn index was
 * being incremented twice during a single action - once in the performAction method and once
 * in the addAction method. This caused inconsistencies in action sequencing and validation.
 * 
 * The fix ensures that the action index is incremented exactly once per game action, maintaining
 * the correct sequence of turns throughout the game lifecycle.
