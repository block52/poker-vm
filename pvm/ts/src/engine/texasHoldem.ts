     * Determines if the current betting round has ended
     *
     * A round ends when all of these conditions are met:
     * 1. For ANTE round: small blind, big blind are posted AND cards are dealt
     * 2. For betting rounds: all non-folded, non-all-in players have acted
     * 3. All active players have either matched the highest bet or folded
     * 4. The last player to raise has been called by all remaining players
     *
     * Edge cases handled:
     * - If all players are folded or all-in, the round ends immediately
     * - Players who folded or are all-in don't need to act again
     * - Players must act after a bet/raise made after their last action
     *
     * @param round The round to check
     * @returns True if the round has ended, false otherwise
