 * Sort tables by available seats (least empty seats first, full tables last)

 * // Tables sorted by fewest available seats first, full tables at bottom:
 * // 1. 8/9 players (1 seat available) - 9-player table
 * // 2. 1/2 players (1 seat available) - 2-player table  
 * // 3. 3/4 players (1 seat available) - 4-player table
 * // 4. 5/6 players (1 seat available) - 6-player table
 * // 5. 7/9 players (2 seats available) - 9-player table
 * // 6. 2/6 players (4 seats available) - 6-player table
 * // 7. 0/4 players (4 seats available - empty) - 4-player table
 * // 8. 0/9 players (9 seats available - empty) - 9-player table
 * // 9. 9/9 players (FULL) - 9-player table
 * // 10. 4/4 players (FULL) - 4-player table
 * // 11. 2/2 players (FULL) - 2-player table
