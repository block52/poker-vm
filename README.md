## Architecture

### CVM (Card Virtual Machine)

The CVM is a virtual card game machine that runs on the Block52 network, responsible for executing card game logic.

### PVM (Poker Virtual Machine)

The PVM runs inside the CVM and handles poker-specific game logic.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose
-   Git
-   Node.js 20+ (for local development)
-   Yarn

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/block52/poker-vm.git
    cd poker-vm
    ```

2. **Start with Docker (one command):**

    ```bash
    ./start-docker.sh
    ```

    Or manually:

    ```bash
    # Copy environment template
    cp .env.example .env

    # Start all services
    make up
    # OR
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3. **Access services:**
    - üé∞ **Poker UI**: http://localhost:5173
    - üîß **PVM API**: http://localhost:8545
    - üîß **API Health**: http://localhost:8545/health
    - üóÑÔ∏è **MongoDB**: mongodb://localhost:27017

### Manual Setup (Development)

## Development

### Local PVM Development

1. **Navigate to PVM directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pvm/ts
    ```

2. **Start local MongoDB:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

3. **Start PVM application:**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    yarn run dev
    ```

4. **Local services:**
    - API: http://localhost:8545
    - MongoDB: `mongodb://node1:Passw0rd123@localhost:27017`

### Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
cd pvm/ts
yarn test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd pvm/ts
yarn build
```

## Docker Deployment

### Quick Docker Setup

The easiest way to run the entire stack:

```bash
# One-command setup
./start-docker.sh

# Or step by step
cp .env.example .env  # Configure as needed
make up               # Start all services
make health           # Check service health
```

## Game Features

### Player Status

The PVM tracks various player states throughout the game:

| Status        | Description                          | Can Act | Receives Cards | Notes                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `SEATED`      | Player has joined but not yet active | ‚ùå      | ‚ùå             | Waiting for next hand to start       |
| `ACTIVE`      | Player is actively participating     | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ             | Default status for joined players    |
| `BUSTED`      | Player has no chips left             | ‚ùå      | ‚ùå             | Eliminated from tournament/cash game |
| `FOLDED`      | Player has folded their hand         | ‚ùå      | ‚ùå             | Cannot act until next hand           |
| `ALL_IN`      | Player has bet all their chips       | ‚ùå      | ‚úÖ             | Eligible for side pots               |
| `SITTING_OUT` | Player is temporarily away           | ‚ùå      | ‚ùå             | Preserves seat, skipped in dealing   |
| `SITTING_IN`  | Player is returning from sitting out | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ             | Transitioning back to active         |
| `SHOWING`     | Player is showing cards at showdown  | ‚ùå      | ‚úÖ             | Cards revealed to table              |

**Status Transitions:**

-   `SEATED` ‚Üí `ACTIVE` (when hand begins)
-   `ACTIVE` ‚Üí `FOLDED` (fold action)
-   `ACTIVE` ‚Üí `ALL_IN` (bet all chips)
-   `ACTIVE` ‚Üí `SITTING_OUT` (sit out action)
-   `SITTING_OUT` ‚Üí `SITTING_IN` (sit in action)
-   `SITTING_IN` ‚Üí `ACTIVE` (next hand starts)
-   `ACTIVE` ‚Üí `SHOWING` (showdown phase)
-   `ACTIVE` ‚Üí `BUSTED` (lose all chips)

## Node Architecture

### Transaction Processing

1. Transactions sent to node
2. Node validates signature, nonce, and balance
3. Transaction added to mempool

### Block Creation

1. Nodes selected in round-robin fashion
2. Transactions pulled from mempool
3. Transactions replayed by order and nonce
4. Account state updated
5. Block created and signed
6. Block broadcast to network

### Block Validation

1. Block received by nodes
2. Validated using public key, merkle root, and signature
3. Block added to blockchain state

## Docker

### Building Image

```bash
cd pvm/ts
docker build -t poker-vm .
docker run -p 8545:8545 poker-vm
```
