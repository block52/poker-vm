## Architecture

### CVM (Card Virtual Machine)

The CVM is a virtual card game machine that runs on the Block52 network, responsible for executing card game logic.

### PVM (Poker Virtual Machine)

The PVM runs inside the CVM and handles poker-specific game logic.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose
-   Git
-   Node.js 18+ (for local development)
-   Yarn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/block52/poker-vm.git
    cd poker-vm
    ```

2. **Start services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

3. **Access services:**
    - PVM RPC: http://localhost:8545
    - API Documentation: http://localhost:8545/docs
    - MongoDB: localhost:27017

## Development

### Local PVM Development

1. **Navigate to PVM directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pvm/ts
    ```

2. **Start local MongoDB:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

3. **Start PVM application:**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    yarn run dev
    ```

4. **Local services:**
    - API: http://localhost:8545
    - MongoDB: `mongodb://node1:Passw0rd123@localhost:27017`

### Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
cd pvm/ts
yarn test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd pvm/ts
yarn build
```

## Game Features

### Player Status

The PVM tracks various player states throughout the game:

| Status        | Description                                  | Can Act | Receives Cards | Notes                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `NOT_ACTED`   | Player hasn't acted in current betting round | ✅      | ✅             | Waiting for player's turn            |
| `ACTIVE`      | Player is actively participating             | ✅      | ✅             | Default status for joined players    |
| `BUSTED`      | Player has no chips left                     | ❌      | ❌             | Eliminated from tournament/cash game |
| `FOLDED`      | Player has folded their hand                 | ❌      | ❌             | Cannot act until next hand           |
| `ALL_IN`      | Player has bet all their chips               | ❌      | ✅             | Eligible for side pots               |
| `SITTING_OUT` | Player is temporarily away                   | ❌      | ❌             | Preserves seat, skipped in dealing   |
| `SITTING_IN`  | Player is returning from sitting out         | ✅      | ✅             | Transitioning back to active         |
| `SHOWING`     | Player is showing cards at showdown          | ❌      | ✅             | Cards revealed to table              |

**Status Transitions:**

-   `NOT_ACTED` → `ACTIVE` (after taking action)
-   `ACTIVE` → `FOLDED` (fold action)
-   `ACTIVE` → `ALL_IN` (bet all chips)
-   `ACTIVE` → `SITTING_OUT` (sit out action)
-   `SITTING_OUT` → `SITTING_IN` (sit in action)
-   `SITTING_IN` → `ACTIVE` (next hand starts)
-   `ACTIVE` → `SHOWING` (showdown phase)
-   `ACTIVE` → `BUSTED` (lose all chips)

### Countdown Timer

Coordinate synchronized game starts using the `gameStart` URL parameter:

```
http://localhost:8545/table/0x123abc?gameStart=2025-06-16T15:30:00Z
```

**Parameter formats:**

-   ISO 8601: `2025-06-16T15:30:00Z`
-   With timezone: `2025-06-16T15:30:00%2B10:00` (URL encoded)
-   Unix timestamp: `1718524200000`

**Features:**

-   Screen lock until countdown completes
-   Live countdown display
-   Auto-cleanup when complete
-   Dev skip button (development mode only)

### Bitcoin Payments

Enable Bitcoin payments by setting in `.env`:

```
BTC_PAY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Node Architecture

### Transaction Processing

1. Transactions sent to node
2. Node validates signature, nonce, and balance
3. Transaction added to mempool

### Block Creation

1. Nodes selected in round-robin fashion
2. Transactions pulled from mempool
3. Transactions replayed by order and nonce
4. Account state updated
5. Block created and signed
6. Block broadcast to network

### Block Validation

1. Block received by nodes
2. Validated using public key, merkle root, and signature
3. Block added to blockchain state

## Docker

### Building Image

```bash
cd pvm/ts
docker build -t poker-vm .
docker run -p 8545:8545 poker-vm
```
